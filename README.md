In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Step 1: Plotly


Use the D3 library to read in samples.json.


Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.




Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.


Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.


Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.
